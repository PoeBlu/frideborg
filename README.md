# frideborg
A simple tool for interacting with McAfee ePo servers.

I wrote this tool while trying to figure out how to interact with McAfee ePo servers using McAfees HTTP based API.
Frideborg can search the ePo for hosts, users and IP addresses. It can also assist you deleting hosts from the ePo catalog.

Using Frideborg you can for example delete a great number of old decommisioned hosts from the ePo without having to search for them one by one.
Frideborg is simply a time saver and you can use it interact with multiple ePo servers.

It should be compatible with all version of the ePo server, but don't take my word for it.
